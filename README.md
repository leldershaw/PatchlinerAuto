# PatchlinerAuto
 The PatchlinerAuto Analysis Workflow was created to assist epilepsy researchers at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in reviewing data output by the Patchliner system. The workflow allows the user to import data, select wells for analysis, view and exclude plots, and visually select time intervals to calculate rise times, steady state current amplitudes, tail currents and conductance for the plots.
